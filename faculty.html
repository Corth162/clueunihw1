1) Faculty/Staff
This webpage uses tables to display the faculty photos and their biography.
I kind of forgot I was supposed to use tables, but I really like this formatting and i am pretty proud of it,
so i was a little to commited to it to change it, sorry, i made a table for the course page to show that i can use them,
 even if it doesnt have images--->
