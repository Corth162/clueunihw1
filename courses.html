        <!--Courses are based on the weapons: courses must be comp sci based, either title
        or desc should be a pun for each of these. The majors we offer are digital informatics,
        comp sci, computer engineer, data science, Advanced AI & Machine Learning

        Cutting-Edge Algorithms (Knife) – Advanced AI & Machine Learning
        Sharpen your skills in advanced algorithmic problem-solving, data structures, and computational efficiency.

        System Overhaul & Optimization (Wrench) – Computer Engineering
        Master hardware-software integration, low-level programming, and troubleshooting techniques to fine-tune system performance.

        Heavy Metal Programming (Lead Pipe) – Computer Science
        Dive deep into systems programming and low-level development with C, Assembly, and embedded systems.
        
        Illuminating Data Structures (Candlestick) – Data Science
        Light the way through complex datasets, visualization techniques, and predictive analytics to uncover hidden patterns and insights.
        
        The Digital Smoking Gun (Revolver) – Digital Informatics
        An upper-level course that pulls together everything—data management, UX/UI, cybersecurity, and system analysis—to build scalable, user-centric solutions.

        Threads (Rope) – Independnt Study
